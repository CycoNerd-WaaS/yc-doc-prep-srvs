# FAQ Page
faq:
  page_title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  
  questions:
    - q: "What is a Legal Document Assistant (LDA)?"
      a: "A Legal Document Assistant is a registered professional who can prepare legal documents at your specific direction. LDAs are not attorneys and cannot provide legal advice, represent you in court, or interpret the law. We help you complete and file paperwork for self-represented (pro per) matters."
    
    - q: "What's the difference between an LDA and an attorney?"
      a: "An attorney can provide legal advice, represent you in court, and make legal decisions on your behalf. An LDA can only prepare documents at your direction and provide general information. If your matter is contested or complex, you may need an attorney."
    
    - q: "What is CTEC and why does it matter?"
      a: "CTEC (California Tax Education Council) registers and regulates tax preparers in California. Using a CTEC-registered preparer ensures they've completed required education and passed background checks. Our CTEC ID is verifiable at ctec.org."
    
    - q: "Do you provide immigration services?"
      a: "No. We do not provide any immigration-related services or documentation. For immigration matters, please consult with a licensed immigration attorney or accredited representative."
    
    - q: "Do you offer payment plans?"
      a: "Payment arrangements may be available depending on the service. Please inquire during your consultation."
    
    - q: "How long does document preparation take?"
      a: "Timeframes vary by document type and complexity. Simple documents may be completed in a few days, while complex matters like divorce may take longer. We'll provide an estimated timeline during your consultation."
    
    - q: "Can you help if my case is contested?"
      a: "For contested matters (where the other party disagrees), we strongly recommend consulting with an attorney. We can only prepare documents for uncontested matters where both parties agree on terms."
